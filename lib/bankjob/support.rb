  # conversion through +strftime()+

  # For example, the 1st of February 2009 at 2:34PM and 56 second becomes "2009-02-01 14:34:56"

Wesabe (http://www.wesabe.com) is an online bank account management tool (like Mint)
that allows you to upload (in some cases automatically) your bank statements and
automatically convert them into a more readable format to allow you to track
your spending and much more. Wesabe comes with its own community attached.

Bankjob has no affiliation with Wesabe, but allows you to upload the statements it
generates to your Wesabe account automatically.

To use Wesabe you need the Wesabe Ruby gem installed:
See the gem at http://github.com/wesabe/wesabe-rubygem
Install the gem with:
  $ sudo gem install -r --source http://gems.github.com/ wesabe-wesabe
(on Windows, omit the "sudo")

You also need your Wesabe login name and password, and, if you have
more than one account on Wesabe, the id number of the account.
This is not a real account number - it's simply a counter that Wesabe uses.
If you have a single account it will be '1', if you have two accounts the
second account will be '2', etc.

Bankjob will help you find this number by listing your Wesabe accounts for you.
Simply use:
  bankjob -wesabe_help "username password"
(The quotes are important - this is a single argument to Bankjob with two words)

If you already know the number of the account and you want to start uploading use:

  bankjob [other bankjob args] --wesabe "username password id"

E.g.
  bankjob --scraper bpi_scraper.rb --wesabe "bloggsy pw123 2"

If you only have a single account, you don't need to specify the id number
(but Bankjob will check and will fail with an error if you have more than one account)

  bankjob [other bankjob args] --wesabe "username password"

If in any doubt --wesabe-help "username password" will set you straight.

Troubleshooting:
- If you see an error like Wesabe::Request::Unauthorized, then chances
  are your username or password for Wesabe is incorrect.

- If you see an error "end of file reached" then it may be that you are logged
  into the Wesabe account to which you are trying to upload - perhaps in a browser.
  In this case, log out from Wesabe in the browser, _wait a minute_, then try again.
