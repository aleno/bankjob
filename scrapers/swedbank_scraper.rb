# SwedbankScraper is a scraper tailored to the Swedbank bank in Sweden (www.swedbank.se).
# It takes advantage of the BaseScraper to create the mechanize agent,
# then followins the basic recipe there of first loading the tranasctions page
# then parsing it.
#
# SwedbankScraper expects the user name and password to be passed on the command line
# using --scraper-args "user password" (with a space between them).
