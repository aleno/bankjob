  ##
  # A Statement object represents a bank statement and is generally the result of running a Bankjob scraper.
  # The Statement holds an array of Transaction objects and specifies the closing balance and the currency in use.
  #
  # A Scraper will create a Statement by scraping web pages in an online banking site.
  # The Statement can then be stored as a file in CSV (Comma Separated Values) format
  # using +to_csv+ or in OFX (Open Financial eXchange http://www.ofx.net) format
  # using +to_ofx+.
  #
  # One special ability of Statement is the ability to merge with an existing statement,
  # automatically eliminating overlapping transactions.
  # This means that when writing subsequent statements to the same CSV file
  # <em>(note well: CSV only)</em> a continous transaction record can be built up
  # over a long period.

    # Finishes the statement after scraping in two ways depending on the information
    # that the scraper was able to obtain. Optionally have your scraper class call
    # this after scraping is finished.
    #
    # This method:
    # 
    # 1. Sets the closing balance and available_balance and the to_ and from_dates
    #    by using the first and last transactions in the list. Which transaction is
    #    used depends on whether +most_recent_first+ is true or false.
    #    The scraper may just set these directly in which case this may not be necessary.
    #
    # 2. If +fake_times+ is true time-stamps are invented and added to the transaction
    #    date attributes. This is useful if the website beings scraped shows dates, but
    #    not times, but has transactions listed in chronoligical arder. 
    #    Without this process, the ofx generated has no proper no indication of the order of
    #    transactions that occurred in the same day other than the order in the statement
    #    and this may be ignored by the client. (Specifically, Wesabe will reorder transactions
    #    in the same day if they all appear to occur at the same time).
    #    
    #    Note that the algorithm to set the fake times is a little tricky. Assuming
    #    the transactionsa are most-recent-first, the first last transaction on each 
    #    day is set at 11:59pm each transaction prior to that is one minute earlier.
    #    
    #    But for the first transactions in the statement, the first is set at a few
    #    minutes after midnight, then we count backward. (The actual number of minutes
    #    is based on the number of transactions + 1 to be sure it doesnt pass midnight)
    #    
    #    This is crucial because transactions for a given day will often span 2 or more
    #    statement. By starting just after midnight and going back to just before midnight
    #    we reduce the chance of overlap.
    #
    #    If the to-date is the same as the from-date for a transaction, then we start at
    #    midday, so that prior and subsequent statements don't overlap.
    #
    #   This simple algorithm basically guarantees no overlaps so long as:
    #   i.  The number of transactions is small compared to the number of minutes in a day
    #   ii. A single day will not span more than 3 statements
    #
    #   If the statement is most-recent-last (+most_recent_first = false+) the same
    #   algorithm is applied, only in reverse
