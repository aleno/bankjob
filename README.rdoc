== DESCRIPTION:

Bankjob is a command-line ruby program for scraping online banking sites and producing statements in OFX (Open Fincancial Exchange) or CSV (Comma Separated Values) formats.

Bankjob was created for people like me who want to get their bank data into a 3rd party application but whose bank does not support downloads in OFX format.
It's also useful for keeping a permanent store of bank statements on your computer for reading in Excel (vs filing paper statements)

== FEATURES:

* Scrapes an online banking website to produce a bank statement
* Stores bank statements locally in CSV files, which can be loaded directly in spreadsheets like Microsoft Excel
* Stores bank statements locally in OFX files, which can be imported by many programs such as Quicken, MS Money, Gnu Cash and uploaded to some web applications
* Supports coding of simple rules in ruby for modifying transaction details. E.g. automatically change "pment inst 3245003" to "paid home loan interest"

== SYNOPSIS:

  bankjob --out csv:c:\bank\foo.csv --scraper c:\bank\my_bpi_scraper.rb
          --scraper-args "<my_username> <my_password>"
          --log c:\bank\bankjob.log --debug

I have this command in a .bat file which is launched daily by a scheduled task on my windows Media Center PC (which, since it's always on and connected to the internet, makes a useful home server)

This one command will:
* scrape my online banking website after logging in as me and navigating to the page with recent transactions
* apply some rules, coded in the my_bpi_scraper.rb file that make the descriptions more readable
* produce a statement in comma-separated-value format, keeping the original raw data as well as the new descriptions,
  storing that in c:\bank\foo.csv
* produce an OFX document with the same statement information
* log debug-level details in bankjob.log

== REQUIREMENTS:

* Runs in ruby so you need to have ruby installed
* Requires a scraper for your online bank site
  Some examples come packaged with Bankjob but you will probably need to write your own scraper in ruby.
