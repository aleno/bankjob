# BpiScraper is a scraper tailored to the BPI bank in Portugal (www.bpinet.pt).
# It takes advantage of the BaseScraper to create the mechanize agent,
# then followins the basic recipe there of first loading the tranasctions page
# then parsing it.
#
# In addition to actually working for the BPI online banking, this class serves
# as an example of how to build your own scraper.
#
# BpiScraper expects the user name and password to be passed on the command line
# using --scraper-args "user password" (with a space between them).
# Optionally, the account number can also be specified with the 3rd argument so:
# --scraper-args "user password 803030000001" causing that account to be selected
# before scraping the statement
#
