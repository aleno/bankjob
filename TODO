* The OFX should (near enough) match the downloadable version on your
  bank website. If they don't and you try to upload to Wesabe it'll
  think you're uploading a new account. I think this means we'll need
  to have a customisable OFX generator.

* Could there be a FreeAgent output plugin?

* Instructions for writing your own scraper would be nice.

* There needs to be a distinction between the account for online
  banking and the bank account. One online banking account may have
  access to several bank accounts.

* If Bankjob::Statement attributes +to_date+ and +from_date+ aren't set
  these should be calculated from the first and last transaction dates.

* Scrapers should be specified the same way that output formatters are.
  bankjob --scraper bpi:"username password" ...

* Get rid of that awful Hoe dependency.
