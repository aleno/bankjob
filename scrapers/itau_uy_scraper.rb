# ItauUYScraper is a scraper tailored to the Itau bank in Uruguay (www.itaulink.com.uy).
# It takes advantage of the BaseScraper to create the mechanize agent,
# then followins the basic recipe there of first loading the tranasctions page
# then parsing it.
#
# This scraper is based on the bci_scraper.
#
# ItauUYScraper expects the user name and password to be passed on the command line
# using --scraper-args "user password" (with a space between them).
# Optionally, the account number can also be specified with the 3rd argument so:
# --scraper-args "user password 1234567" causing that account to be selected
# before scraping the statement
#
