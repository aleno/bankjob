##
# HbosScraper is a scraper tailored to the HBOS bank in the UK (http://www.bankofscotland.co.uk/).
# It takes advantage of the BaseScraper to create the mechanize agent,
# then followins the basic recipe there of first loading the tranasctions page
# then parsing it.
#
# In addition to actually working for the HBOS online banking, this class serves
# as an example of how to build your own scraper.
#
# HbosScraper expects the user name and password to be passed on the command line
# using -scraper_args "user password" (with a space between them).
