* The OFX should (near enough) match the downloadable version on your
  bank website. If they don't and you try to upload to Wesabe it'll
  think you're uploading a new account. I think this means we'll need
  to have a customisable OFX generator.

* It'd be nice to have pluggable output mechanisms so I could do eg
  bankjob --out json:/path/to/wherever.json --out ofx:/path/to/other.ofx

* Wesabe should be an output plugin.
  bankjob --out wesabe:"<username> <password> <bank_account_id>"

* Some bank accounts don't have both bank_id and account_id. Credit
  cards for example only have a card number.

* Instructions for writing your own scraper would be nice.

* There needs to be a distinction between the account for online
  banking and the bank account. One online banking account may have
  access to several bank accounts.

* If Bankjob::Statement attributes +to_date+ and +from_date+ aren't set
  these should be calculated from the first and last transaction dates.
